This saves time and ensures consistency when managing a large number of products.</p>
<p><br><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
<p>There are two main ways to use the bulk upload feature:</p>
<p><br><strong>1. Add New Products</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Download the <strong>CSV template</strong> from this section.</li>
<li>Add your products into the CSV file by filling in the required and optional columns.</li>
<li>Upload the completed CSV file back into the system.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Important:</em> Please pay attention to the data type of each column (e.g., numbers, text, dates). You can see detailed explanations of all required and optional columns in the table below.</p>
<p><strong>2. Edit Existing Products</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Add an <strong>"id"</strong> column to the CSV template. (You can find the product ID numbers on the <strong>Products</strong> page.)</li>
<li>Include only the columns you want to update (for example, price, stock, etc.).</li>
<li>Upload the updated CSV file to apply the changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if you want to update the stock and prices of your products, your CSV file should look like this:</p>
<pre style="background: #f7f7f7; padding: 10px; border-radius: 6px; overflow-x: auto;">"id","price","price_discounted","stock"
"1","30","20","1000"
"5","40","40","500"
</pre>
<p style="color: #ba372a;">* To update product prices, you must include both the <strong>"price"</strong> and <strong>"price_discounted"</strong> columns in your CSV file.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Multi-language Support</strong></p>
<p>The CSV upload feature also supports <strong>multiple languages</strong>. This allows you to add product information in more than one language, making your store multilingual.</p>
<p><strong>How to Add Multiple Languages</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Each language in your system has a <strong>Language ID</strong> (for example, English = 1, German = 2). You can find the language ID numbers on the <strong>Languages</strong> page.</li>
<li>In your CSV file, add extra columns for each language, following this format:
<ul>
<li>For the main language: <code>title</code>, <code>short_description</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>tags</code></li>
<li>For a second language with ID 2: <code>title_lang2</code>, <code>short_description_lang2</code>, <code>description_lang2</code>, <code>tags_lang2</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you upload your CSV file, the system will automatically detect and save the translations.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<pre style="background: #f7f7f7; padding: 10px; border-radius: 6px; overflow-x: auto;">"id","title","short_description","description","tags",....,"title_lang2","short_description_lang2","description_lang2","tags_lang2"
"1","Red Dress","Beautiful red dress","A lovely red dress for summer","dress,red,fashion",....,"Rotes Kleid","Schönes rotes Kleid","Ein hübsches rotes Kleid für den Sommer","kleid,rot,mode"
</pre>
<p>In this example: - The product is added in English (main language). - The same product details are also added in German (Language ID: 2). - Both language versions will be available on your site.</p>
